# Hetereogeous Learning Rates for Solving Barren Plateau in Quantum Neural Networks

1. Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) -> base code provided in main.py
2. Learn Quantum Neural Network by reading the provided main.py code and from the shared paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.06201.pdf)
3. Understand the barrent plateau in quantum neural networks (see https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07090-4.pdf)
4. Adjust quantum and classical learning rates for performance improvement. Please try large LR like 0.1 for quantum NN, and small one like 0.001 for classical NN. Quantum NN needs large learning rates to get rid of local optimal (the possible reason for barrent plateau in QNN). See http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/you21c/you21c.pdf
5. Plot gradients for barren plateau visulization.
